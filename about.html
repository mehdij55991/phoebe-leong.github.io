                Ph3b3 started learning HTML and CSS around 2018, during fifth grade.<br>
                The first real programming language they learnt was C++, when they decided to make a program for their crush. It failed.<br>
                Ph3be would later revisit the language in high school (but never become any good at it).<br><br>
            
                They became a musician in 2015 when they started learning the drums.<br>
                Then, in 2020, they launched their SoundCloud account and begun posting on it.<br>
                To this day, Ph3b3 is making music and continues to play the drums alongside other instruments.
