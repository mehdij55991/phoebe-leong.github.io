            <p>Ph3b3 first started learning HTML and CSS around 2018, when she was in year 5.<br>
            The first real programming language she (half) learnt was C++, when she decided to make a program for her crush. It failed.<br>
            Ph3be would later revisit the language in high school, but at the time she didn't know that.<br><br>
            
            She first started as a musician in 2015 when she started learning the drums.<br>
            Then, in 2020, she launched her SoundCloud account and begun posting on it.<br>
            In 2021 she posted frequently.<br><br>
        
            She plans to get a computer science degree at the University of Sydney and hopefully post more consistently on her SoundCloud.</p>
